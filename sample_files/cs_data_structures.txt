=== BINARY TREES ===

1. Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - Left subtree contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node's key
   - Right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key
   - Both left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees

2. AVL Tree Operations:
   - Insertion: O(log n)
   - Deletion: O(log n) 
   - Search: O(log n)
   
3. Tree Traversals:
   - Inorder: Left -> Root -> Right
   - Preorder: Root -> Left -> Right
   - Postorder: Left -> Right -> Root

=== GRAPH ALGORITHMS ===

Dijkstra's Algorithm:
1. Initialize distance to all vertices as infinity
2. Set distance to source as 0
3. Pick minimum distance vertex not yet processed
4. Update distance values of adjacent vertices

Time Complexity: O(V²) with adjacency matrix
Space Complexity: O(V)

=== SORTING ALGORITHMS ===

Quick Sort:
- Average case: O(n log n)
- Worst case: O(n²)
- Best case: O(n log n)
- Space: O(log n)

Merge Sort:
- All cases: O(n log n)
- Space: O(n)

=== DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING ===

Fibonacci Sequence:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Base cases: F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1

Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):
- Used in diff utilities, bioinformatics
- Time: O(mn), Space: O(mn)

=== CODING INTERVIEW TIPS ===

1. Always clarify the problem statement
2. Start with a brute force solution
3. Optimize step by step
4. Consider edge cases
5. Test with sample inputs

Common Patterns:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Fast & Slow Pointers
- Merge Intervals
- Cyclic Sort
