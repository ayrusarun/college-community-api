=== DNA STRUCTURE AND REPLICATION ===

DNA Structure:
- Double helix model (Watson & Crick)
- Antiparallel strands (5' to 3' direction)
- Base pairing: A-T, G-C
- Major and minor grooves

DNA Replication:
1. Initiation: Origin of replication (oriC)
2. Elongation: Leading and lagging strands
3. Termination: Ter sites

Key Enzymes:
- DNA Helicase: Unwinds double helix
- DNA Primase: Synthesizes RNA primers
- DNA Polymerase III: Main replicating enzyme
- DNA Ligase: Joins Okazaki fragments

=== GENE EXPRESSION ===

Central Dogma:
DNA → RNA → Protein

Transcription Process:
1. Initiation: RNA polymerase binds to promoter
2. Elongation: RNA synthesis in 5' to 3' direction
3. Termination: Rho-dependent or independent

Translation Process:
1. Initiation: Ribosome assembly at start codon
2. Elongation: Peptide bond formation
3. Termination: Stop codon recognition

Genetic Code:
- 64 codons (61 sense + 3 stop)
- Degeneracy: Multiple codons for same amino acid
- Universality: Same code across species
