=== DISCRETE-TIME SIGNALS ===

Unit Impulse Function:
δ[n] = {1, if n = 0; 0, otherwise}

Unit Step Function:
u[n] = {1, if n ≥ 0; 0, if n < 0}

Exponential Sequence:
x[n] = aⁿu[n], where a is a complex constant

Sinusoidal Sequence:
x[n] = A cos(ωn + φ)

=== Z-TRANSFORM ===

Definition:
X(z) = Σ x[n]z⁻ⁿ (from n=-∞ to ∞)

Properties:
1. Linearity: Z{ax[n] + by[n]} = aX(z) + bY(z)
2. Time Shifting: Z{x[n-k]} = z⁻ᵏX(z)
3. Scaling: Z{aⁿx[n]} = X(z/a)
4. Convolution: Z{x[n]*h[n]} = X(z)H(z)

Common Transform Pairs:
- δ[n] ↔ 1
- u[n] ↔ z/(z-1)
- aⁿu[n] ↔ z/(z-a)
- naⁿu[n] ↔ az/(z-a)²

=== DIGITAL FILTERS ===

FIR (Finite Impulse Response):
- Always stable
- Linear phase possible
- No feedback
- h[n] = 0 for n < 0 and n ≥ N

IIR (Infinite Impulse Response):
- Can be unstable
- Efficient implementation
- Uses feedback
- Recursive structure

Filter Design Methods:
1. Window Method (FIR)
2. Frequency Sampling (FIR)
3. Bilinear Transform (IIR)
4. Impulse Invariance (IIR)

=== DISCRETE FOURIER TRANSFORM (DFT) ===

N-point DFT:
X[k] = Σ x[n]e⁻ʲ²πkn/N (from n=0 to N-1)

Inverse DFT:
x[n] = (1/N) Σ X[k]eʲ²πkn/N (from k=0 to N-1)

Properties:
- Periodicity: X[k] = X[k+N]
- Symmetry: For real x[n], X[k] = X*[N-k]
- Circular Convolution: DFT{x[n]⊛y[n]} = X[k]Y[k]

=== FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM (FFT) ===

Decimation-in-Time (DIT):
- Divide input sequence
- Combine frequency domain
- Complexity: O(N log₂ N)

Decimation-in-Frequency (DIF):
- Divide frequency domain
- Combine time domain
- Butterfly computations

Applications:
- Spectrum Analysis
- Digital Filtering
- Image Processing
- Audio Processing

=== MULTIRATE SIGNAL PROCESSING ===

Decimation (Downsampling):
y[n] = x[Mn], where M is decimation factor
- Anti-aliasing filter required
- Sampling rate reduced by factor M

Interpolation (Upsampling):
- Insert zeros between samples
- Anti-imaging filter required
- Sampling rate increased by factor L
