Semester: Spring 2024
Department: Civil Engineering

=== STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS METHODS ===

Classical Methods:
1. Method of Joints (Truss Analysis)
2. Method of Sections (Truss Analysis)
3. Moment Distribution Method
4. Slope Deflection Method
5. Virtual Work Method

Modern Methods:
1. Matrix Structural Analysis
2. Finite Element Method (FEM)
3. Computer-Aided Analysis

=== STATICALLY DETERMINATE STRUCTURES ===

Equilibrium Equations:
- ΣFx = 0 (Sum of horizontal forces)
- ΣFy = 0 (Sum of vertical forces)
- ΣM = 0 (Sum of moments)

Support Reactions:
1. Roller Support: 1 reaction (vertical)
2. Pin Support: 2 reactions (horizontal & vertical)
3. Fixed Support: 3 reactions (2 forces + 1 moment)

Degree of Static Indeterminacy:
DSI = (r + m) - 2j
Where: r = reactions, m = members, j = joints

=== INFLUENCE LINES ===

Definition: Diagram showing variation of response function
at a specific point due to unit load moving across structure

Applications:
- Maximum positive/negative moments
- Maximum shear forces
- Critical load positions
- Bridge design analysis

Müller-Breslau Principle:
Influence line for any response function is proportional to
the deflected shape when a unit displacement is applied
corresponding to that response.

=== INDETERMINATE STRUCTURES ===

Force Method (Flexibility Method):
1. Identify degree of indeterminacy
2. Remove redundant forces/moments
3. Apply unit redundant forces
4. Use compatibility equations
5. Solve for redundant forces

Displacement Method (Stiffness Method):
1. Identify degrees of freedom
2. Apply unit displacements
3. Calculate element stiffness matrices
4. Assemble global stiffness matrix
5. Solve K{Δ} = {F}

=== MOMENT DISTRIBUTION METHOD ===

Developed by Hardy Cross (1930)

Key Concepts:
- Distribution Factor: DF = Kᵢ/ΣK
- Carry-Over Factor: COF = 1/2 (for prismatic members)
- Fixed End Moments (FEM)

Procedure:
1. Calculate FEMs for all members
2. Calculate distribution factors at each joint
3. Balance moments by distributing unbalanced moments
4. Carry over moments to far ends
5. Repeat until convergence

=== PLASTIC ANALYSIS ===

Limit State Design Philosophy:
- Ultimate Limit State
- Serviceability Limit State

Plastic Hinge Formation:
Mp = fy × Z (Plastic section modulus)

Collapse Mechanism:
- Beam mechanism
- Sway mechanism
- Combined mechanism

Virtual Work Method for Plastic Analysis:
External work = Internal work
ΣPδ = ΣMpθ

=== DEFLECTION CALCULATIONS ===

Methods:
1. Double Integration Method
2. Moment-Area Method
3. Conjugate Beam Method
4. Virtual Work Method (Unit Load Method)
5. Castigliano's Theorem

Moment-Area Theorems:
Theorem 1: θB/A = (1/EI) × Area of M/EI diagram between A and B
Theorem 2: ΔB/A = (1/EI) × Moment of M/EI area about B
