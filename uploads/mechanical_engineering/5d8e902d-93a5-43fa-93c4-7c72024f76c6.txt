=== FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS ===

Energy Conservation Principle:
ΔU = Q - W

Where:
- ΔU = Change in internal energy
- Q = Heat added to the system
- W = Work done by the system

For a closed system:
dU = δQ - δW

=== THERMODYNAMIC PROCESSES ===

1. Isothermal Process (Constant Temperature):
   - PV = constant
   - ΔU = 0 (for ideal gas)
   - W = nRT ln(V₂/V₁)

2. Adiabatic Process (No heat transfer):
   - PVᵞ = constant
   - Q = 0
   - W = (P₁V₁ - P₂V₂)/(γ-1)

3. Isochoric Process (Constant Volume):
   - V = constant
   - W = 0
   - Q = nCᵥΔT

4. Isobaric Process (Constant Pressure):
   - P = constant
   - W = PΔV
   - Q = nCₚΔT

=== HEAT ENGINES ===

Carnot Engine Efficiency:
η = 1 - (T_cold/T_hot)

Otto Cycle (Gasoline Engine):
1. Adiabatic compression
2. Constant volume heat addition
3. Adiabatic expansion
4. Constant volume heat rejection

Diesel Cycle:
1. Adiabatic compression
2. Constant pressure heat addition
3. Adiabatic expansion
4. Constant volume heat rejection

=== REFRIGERATION CYCLE ===

Coefficient of Performance (COP):
COP = Q_cold / W_input

Vapor Compression Cycle:
1. Compression (1-2): Isentropic
2. Condensation (2-3): Isobaric
3. Expansion (3-4): Isenthalpic
4. Evaporation (4-1): Isobaric

=== STEAM TABLES ===

Properties of saturated steam:
- Saturation temperature vs pressure
- Specific volume (vf, vg, vfg)
- Enthalpy (hf, hg, hfg)
- Entropy (sf, sg, sfg)

Quality of wet steam:
x = mg/(mf + mg)
