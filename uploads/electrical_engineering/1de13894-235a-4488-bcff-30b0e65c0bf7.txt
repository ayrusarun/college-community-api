=== LOAD FLOW ANALYSIS ===

Objective: Determine voltage magnitude and phase angle
at each bus for specified generation and load

Bus Classifications:
1. Slack Bus (Reference Bus):
   - |V| and δ specified
   - P and Q calculated

2. PV Bus (Generator Bus):
   - P and |V| specified
   - Q and δ calculated

=== FAULT ANALYSIS ===

Types of Faults:
1. Three-phase fault (Symmetrical)
2. Single line-to-ground fault
3. Line-to-line fault
4. Double line-to-ground fault

Symmetrical Components:
- Positive sequence (a₀ = 1)
- Negative sequence (a₂ = a²)
- Zero sequence (a₁ = a)

Where a = e^(j120°) = -0.5 + j0.866

Sequence Networks:
- Positive sequence: Normal operating impedances
- Negative sequence: Same as positive (for static equipment)
- Zero sequence: Depends on grounding and line configuration

Fault Calculations:
Three-phase fault current:
If = Vf / (Z₁ + Zf)

Where:
- Vf = Pre-fault voltage
- Z₁ = Positive sequence impedance
- Zf = Fault impedance

2. Transient Stability
3. Dynamic Stability

Equal Area Criterion:
- Used for transient stability analysis
- Accelerating area = Decelerating area
- Critical clearing angle determination

Swing Equation:
M(d²δ/dt²) = Pm - Pe

Where:
- M = Inertia constant
- δ = Rotor angle
- Pm = Mechanical power
- Pe = Electrical power

Power-Angle Characteristics:
P = (E₁E₂/X) sin δ

Where:
- E₁, E₂ = Internal EMFs of machines
- X = Reactance between machines
- δ = Power angle
