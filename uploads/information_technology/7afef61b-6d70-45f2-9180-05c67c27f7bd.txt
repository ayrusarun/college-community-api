Information Technology - Database Management Systems

Course: IT302 - Database Management Systems
Semester: Spring 2024
Department: Information Technology

=== DATABASE CONCEPTS ===

Database: Organized collection of structured data
DBMS: Software system for managing databases

Characteristics of Database Approach:
- Data independence
- Efficient data access
- Data integrity and security
- Data administration
- Concurrent access and crash recovery
- Reduced application development time

Database Users:
1. End users (naive, sophisticated, standalone)
2. Database administrators (DBAs)
3. Database designers
4. Application programmers
5. System analysts

=== DATABASE MODELS ===

Hierarchical Model:
- Tree-like structure
- Parent-child relationships
- Examples: IMS (IBM)

Network Model:
- Graph structure
- Many-to-many relationships
- CODASYL standards

Relational Model:
- Tables (relations)
- Rows (tuples) and columns (attributes)
- Primary and foreign keys
- Most widely used

Object-Oriented Model:
- Objects with attributes and methods
- Inheritance and encapsulation
- Complex data types

=== RELATIONAL MODEL ===

Basic Concepts:
- Relation (table)
- Tuple (row)
- Attribute (column)
- Domain (set of values)
- Degree (number of attributes)
- Cardinality (number of tuples)

Keys:
1. Super key: Set of attributes that uniquely identify tuples
2. Candidate key: Minimal super key
3. Primary key: Chosen candidate key
4. Foreign key: References primary key of another relation
5. Composite key: Key with multiple attributes

Integrity Constraints:
1. Entity Integrity: Primary key cannot be NULL
2. Referential Integrity: Foreign key must match existing primary key
3. Domain Integrity: Values must be from specified domain

=== STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE (SQL) ===

Data Definition Language (DDL):
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Departments(dept_id)
);

ALTER TABLE Students ADD COLUMN phone VARCHAR(15);
DROP TABLE Students;
```

Data Manipulation Language (DML):
```sql
-- INSERT
INSERT INTO Students VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 'john@email.com', 101);

-- SELECT
SELECT name, email FROM Students WHERE department_id = 101;

-- UPDATE
UPDATE Students SET email = 'newemail@email.com' WHERE student_id = 1;

-- DELETE
DELETE FROM Students WHERE student_id = 1;
```

Advanced SQL:
```sql
-- Joins
SELECT s.name, d.dept_name 
FROM Students s JOIN Departments d ON s.department_id = d.dept_id;

-- Subqueries
SELECT name FROM Students WHERE department_id IN 
    (SELECT dept_id FROM Departments WHERE dept_name = 'Computer Science');

-- Aggregate Functions
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) as student_count 
FROM Students GROUP BY department_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```

=== DATABASE DESIGN ===

Entity-Relationship (ER) Model:
- Entities: Objects or things
- Attributes: Properties of entities
- Relationships: Associations between entities

ER Diagram Components:
- Rectangles: Entities
- Ellipses: Attributes
- Diamonds: Relationships
- Lines: Connections

Relationship Types:
1. One-to-One (1:1)
2. One-to-Many (1:M)
3. Many-to-Many (M:N)

Participation Constraints:
- Total participation (double lines)
- Partial participation (single lines)

=== NORMALIZATION ===

Purpose: Eliminate data redundancy and update anomalies

Normal Forms:
1. First Normal Form (1NF):
   - Atomic values only
   - No repeating groups

2. Second Normal Form (2NF):
   - 1NF + No partial dependencies
   - Non-key attributes fully dependent on primary key

3. Third Normal Form (3NF):
   - 2NF + No transitive dependencies
   - Non-key attributes not dependent on other non-key attributes

4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):
   - 3NF + Every determinant is a candidate key

Functional Dependencies:
X → Y: If two tuples have same X value, they must have same Y value

Decomposition:
- Lossless join decomposition
- Dependency preservation

=== TRANSACTION MANAGEMENT ===

Transaction: Collection of operations forming single logical unit

ACID Properties:
1. Atomicity: All or nothing execution
2. Consistency: Database remains in consistent state
3. Isolation: Concurrent transactions don't interfere
4. Durability: Committed changes are permanent

Transaction States:
- Active: Initial state, transaction executing
- Partially committed: After final statement executed
- Failed: Cannot proceed with normal execution
- Aborted: Transaction rolled back
- Committed: Transaction completed successfully

Concurrency Control:
Lock-based protocols:
- Shared locks (S)
- Exclusive locks (X)
- Two-phase locking (2PL)

Deadlock:
- Prevention
- Detection and recovery
- Avoidance (wound-wait, wait-die)

=== DATABASE RECOVERY ===

Failure Types:
1. Transaction failure
2. System failure
3. Media failure

Recovery Techniques:
1. Log-based recovery
2. Shadow paging
3. Checkpointing

Write-Ahead Logging (WAL):
- Log record written before data modification
- UNDO and REDO operations
- Commit protocol

=== INDEXING AND HASHING ===

Indexing:
Purpose: Speed up data retrieval

Types:
1. Primary index: On primary key
2. Secondary index: On non-key attributes
3. Clustering index: On ordered file
4. Dense vs. Sparse indexing

B+ Trees:
- Balanced tree structure
- All data in leaf nodes
- Efficient range queries
- Logarithmic search time

Hashing:
- Hash function maps key to bucket
- Static vs. Dynamic hashing
- Collision resolution (chaining, open addressing)

=== DATABASE ARCHITECTURE ===

Three-Level Architecture:
1. External Level: User views
2. Conceptual Level: Logical structure
3. Internal Level: Physical storage

Data Independence:
- Logical data independence
- Physical data independence

Centralized vs. Distributed Databases:
- Data distribution
- Replication strategies
- Distributed query processing

=== EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES ===

NoSQL Databases:
1. Document stores (MongoDB)
2. Key-value stores (Redis)
3. Column-family (Cassandra)
4. Graph databases (Neo4j)

Big Data:
- Hadoop ecosystem
- MapReduce paradigm
- Spark for in-memory processing

Cloud Databases:
- Database as a Service (DBaaS)
- Scalability and elasticity
- Multi-tenancy

In-Memory Databases:
- Faster data access
- Real-time analytics
- Examples: SAP HANA, Redis
