Course: CH401 - Process Control Systems
Semester: Spring 2024
Department: Chemical Engineering

=== CONTROL SYSTEM FUNDAMENTALS ===

Basic Control Loop Components:
1. Process (Plant)
2. Sensor/Transmitter
3. Controller
4. Final Control Element (Valve)

Control Objectives:
- Regulate process variables at setpoint
- Minimize deviation from desired conditions
- Ensure process safety and stability
- Optimize process performance

Types of Control:
1. Feedback Control (Closed-loop)
2. Feedforward Control (Open-loop)
3. Cascade Control
4. Ratio Control
5. Override Control

=== MATHEMATICAL MODELING ===

Transfer Function:
G(s) = Y(s)/X(s)

First-Order System:
G(s) = K/(τs + 1)

Where:
- K = Process gain
- τ = Time constant
- Response: y(t) = K(1 - e^(-t/τ))

Second-Order System:
G(s) = K/(τ²s² + 2ζτs + 1)

Where:
- ζ = Damping coefficient
- Responses: Overdamped (ζ>1), Critically damped (ζ=1), Underdamped (ζ<1)

Time Delay (Dead Time):
G(s) = Ke^(-θs)/(τs + 1)

=== CONTROLLER DESIGN ===

PID Controller:
u(t) = Kc[e(t) + (1/τI)∫e(t)dt + τD(de/dt)]

Transfer function:
Gc(s) = Kc(1 + 1/(τIs) + τDs)

Ziegler-Nichols Tuning:
Method 1 (Step Response):
- Kc = 1.2/RL
- τI = 2L
- τD = 0.5L

Method 2 (Ultimate Gain):
- Kc = 0.6Kcu
- τI = 0.5Tu
- τD = 0.125Tu

Where:
- R = Reaction rate
- L = Lag time
- Kcu = Ultimate gain
- Tu = Ultimate period

=== ADVANCED CONTROL STRATEGIES ===

Cascade Control:
- Primary (master) controller
- Secondary (slave) controller
- Faster response to disturbances
- Improved performance

Feedforward Control:
- Measures disturbances directly
- Corrective action before effect appears
- Combined with feedback for offset elimination

Model Predictive Control (MPC):
- Predicts future plant behavior
- Optimizes control moves
- Handles constraints explicitly
- Rolling horizon optimization
